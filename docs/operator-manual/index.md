# Operator Manual Overview

This manual is for Compliant Kubernetes operators.

Operators can be described via the following user stories:

* As an operator I want to create/destroy/upgrade a Compliant Kubernetes cluster.
* As an operator I want to re-configure a Compliant Kubernetes cluster.
* As an on-call operator I want to be alerted when abnormal activity is detected, suggesting a pending intrusion.
* As an on-call operator I want to be alerted when the Compliant Kubernetes cluster is unhealthy.
* As an on-call operator I want "break glass" to investigate and recover an unhealthy Compliant Kubernetes cluster.
