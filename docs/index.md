# Welcome to Compliant Kubernetes

Compliant Kubernetes is a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) distribution, i.e., an opinionated way of packaging and configuring Kubernetes together with other projects. Compliant Kubernetes reduces the compliant burden, as required to comply with:

* [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)](https://elastisys.com/hipaa-compliance-kubernetes-privacy-rule/)
* [Swedish Healthcare (Patientdatalagen)](https://elastisys.com/how-to-use-kubernetes-in-swedish-healthcare/)
* General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
* Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
* Finansinspektionen's Regulatory Code (e.g., FFFS 2014:7)
* Other regulations that map to information security standards, such as ISO 27001
